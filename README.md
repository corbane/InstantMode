This plugin switches Rhino to instant commands mode.
To write a command in the command line, you need to press the space bar.

- Only works on Windows.
- Tested only on Rhino 7.
- The compiled plugin can be found in publish/net48.


### Steps:

- Install the plugin.
  **Important!!**
  After installing the plugin, you can no longer use the space bar as the enter key.

- Press the space bar.
- Type the command `_ShowInstanceModeOptions` to import the keyboard shortcuts.

### Bug:

- As you can see in the video, there is a bug when saving the keyboard shortcuts.
  You need to close the options window and reopen it.
